    - Enables communication between upstream (STE/RES) and backend systems (STM, DBA).
    - Serves as the transport format for both synchronous and asynchronous flows.

  notes: |-
    **Segment Separators:**
    - Data element separator: "+"
    - Component separator: ":"
    - Segment terminator: "'"

  naming_convention: |-
    **EDIFACT Message Naming Convention (Amadeus Format)**  
    Messages use a six-character format that encodes their purpose and domain:

    **Pattern:** `XYYYZW`

    - **X:** Domain or business area  
      - P = PNR / Reservation  
      - I = Inventory  
      - T = Ticketing / Pricing  
      - S = Seating  
      - F = Fares / SSP  
      - C = DCS / CM  

    - **YYY:** Functional abbreviation — represents the feature or action type.  
    - **Z:** Operation type — defines the intent of the message.  
      - U = Update  
      - A = Add  
      - D = Delete  

    - **W:** Message nature — defines how it’s used.  
      - Q = Query  
      - R = Response  
      - S = Standalone Feed  

    **Example:**  
    `SEOTUQ`  
    - **S** → Seating domain  
    - **EOT** → Functional abbreviation  
    - **U** → Update  
    - **Q** → Query  

  segments: |-
    **Common EDIFACT Message Segments**

    - **UNB (Interchange Header):**  
      Identifies sender, receiver, date/time, and control reference.  
      Example: `UNB+IATB:1+1A0SI+1ASRNIP+250218:0713+0VCOC0E6M70001+++O'`

    - **UNH (Message Header):**  
      Identifies the message type and version.  
      Example: `UNH+1+TIPNRQ:08:1:1A+00020V96216O6S'`

    - **DCX (Amadeus-specific Segment):**  
      Carries contextual data such as pricing qualifiers, channel info, or operational flags.  
      Example: `<UKEY VAL="8X1TZNV4XRWZ0WUG0T65P0YZ60" TRXNB="2"/><OFFICEID VALUE="TYOJA2238"/><AREACODE VALUE="A"/>`

    - **UNT (Message Trailer):**  
      Indicates the number of segments and repeats the message reference.  
      Example: `UNT+6+1'`

    - **UNZ (Interchange Trailer):**  
      Closes the message envelope.  
      Example: `UNZ+1+12345'`

    - **MSG (Message Content):**  
      Contains the main business data (e.g., pricing, allocation, or seatmap details).  

    Together, these segments define the structural backbone of EDIFACT-based messages used in airline and travel systems for reliable, high-volume data exchange.

COM_Parameters:
